# Getting Started - Connectivity & Access

This workshop uses the [NSO Reservable Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/DevNet/catalog/nso-sandbox_nso){:target="_blank"} and related NSO DevNet sandboxes. You can reserve and use these sandboxes to follow along with the content.

Connectivity to the lab is typically via **Cisco Secure Client** (or OpenConnect on Linux) to an instance specific to your seat, or via a VPNLess option when offered.

## Connection details

*For future shows, VPN addresses, passwords, and VPNLess (Git) links will be listed here so you can connect to your assigned pod.*
