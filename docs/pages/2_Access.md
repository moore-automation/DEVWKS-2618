## Examine NSO Deployment

In the Sandbox, there are three different instances of Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO). These instances have been pre-provisioned with the necessary Network Element Drivers (NEDs) and configured to manage the devices in the lab topology.

For the purpose of this workshop, we will focus on two specific NSO environments:

**Development NSO:** [NSO Development](http://10.10.20.47:8080/login.html){:target="_blank"}

**Production NSO:** [NSO Production](http://10.10.20.48:8080/login.html){:target="_blank"}

The [NSO Development](http://10.10.20.47:8080/login.html){:target="_blank"} environment is used to simulate a testing environment where we can validate our changes before deploying them to the production environment. This ensures that any modifications are thoroughly tested and verified, reducing the risk of issues in the [NSO Production](http://10.10.20.48:8080/login.html){:target="_blank"} environment.

### Log into NSO
